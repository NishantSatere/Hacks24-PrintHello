## About Us
We are a team of four enthusiastic individuals participating in the TESC Hackathon. Our team focuses on the domain of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML). With a passion for innovation and problem-solving, we are excited to collaborate and create impactful projects.

## Project Description
Our project aims to streamline the workflow for medical professionals by implementing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and a Language Learning Model (LLM) chatbot.

### OCR Implementation
- **Technology Used:** Tesseract
- **Accuracy:** 70-80%
- **Functionality:** Extracts text from medical documents and stores it in JSON format in a MongoDB database. This process reduces manual entry errors and simplifies the work for doctors.

### LLM Chatbot
- **Functionality:** The chatbot interacts with PDF documents and extracts relevant data from the database using a vector database.
- **Benefit:** Enhances user interaction and provides easy access to necessary information.
